Android final project for my high school Mobile Application Development course. This application allows you to create a personal account where you can design your own virtual pet. You are able to interact with your animal and maintain it's health bar, while also using the built-in messaging system to chat with other users on the app!

**Main features include**:
* In-app data and information stored using Firebase
* Use of RecyclerView and custom dialog boxes
* Inclusion of animations, custom graphics, and audio files

**An overview of the app's UI**:
